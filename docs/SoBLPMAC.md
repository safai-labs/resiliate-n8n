# SoBLPMAC - Bell-LaPadula Mandatory Access Control

## Overview

**SoBLPMAC** (Bell-LaPadula Mandatory Access Control) is a Security Orchestrator plugin that provides mandatory access control per the Bell-LaPadula MAC model within the Resiliate ecosystem. This plugin enables storage of compartmentalized hierarchical access controls and supports both SELinux MAC modules and ordered group-based access control systems.

## Description

SoBLPMAC implements the Bell-LaPadula security model, which is designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information by enforcing strict access controls based on security clearance levels and information classification. The plugin supports multi-level security environments such as classified, secret, and top-secret classifications, as well as any other organizational security label schemes.

## Bell-LaPadula Security Model

The Bell-LaPadula model is founded on two fundamental security properties:

### 1. Simple Security Property (No Read Up)
- Subjects at a given security level cannot read information at a higher security level
- Prevents unauthorized access to classified information
- Ensures information flows only from higher to lower security levels
- Also known as the "No Read Up" rule

### 2. Star Security Property (No Write Down)
- Subjects at a given security level cannot write information to a lower security level
- Prevents unauthorized disclosure of classified information
- Ensures that high-level information cannot contaminate lower-level systems
- Also known as the "No Write Down" rule

### 3. Discretionary Security Property
- Access control based on the identity of subjects and objects
- Allows for flexible access control within the same security level
- Supports traditional access control mechanisms alongside mandatory controls

## Key Features

### Multi-Level Security (MLS)
- **Hierarchical Classifications**: Support for multiple security levels (Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret)
- **Compartmentalized Access**: Fine-grained access control within security levels
- **Cross-Level Controls**: Strict enforcement of information flow between levels
- **Custom Classifications**: Support for organization-specific security labels

### Flexible Implementation
- **SELinux Integration**: Full support for SELinux MAC modules and policies
- **Ordered Groups**: Alternative implementation using ordered group memberships
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of SELinux and group-based controls
- **Policy Customization**: Configurable security policies for different environments

### Compartmentalization Support
- **Need-to-Know Basis**: Access control based on compartmented information
- **Project-Based Access**: Compartmentalization by projects or departments
- **Temporal Access**: Time-based access restrictions and controls
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Location-based access limitations

## Security Classifications

### Standard Government Classifications
1. **Top Secret**: Information requiring the highest degree of protection
2. **Secret**: Information requiring substantial degree of protection
3. **Confidential**: Information requiring some degree of protection
4. **Restricted**: Information with limited distribution
5. **Unclassified**: Information available for general access

### Commercial Classifications
1. **Highly Confidential**: Critical business information
2. **Confidential**: Sensitive business information
3. **Internal Use**: Information for internal use only
4. **Public**: Information available to the public

### Custom Classifications
Organizations can define specific classifications such as:
- **Executive Only**: Information for executive leadership only
- **Department Specific**: Information restricted to specific departments
- **Project Classified**: Information classified by project or initiative
- **Partner Restricted**: Information shared with specific partners
- **Time Sensitive**: Information with temporal access restrictions

## Technical Implementation

### Security Level Assignment
```python
class BellLaPadulaController:
    def assign_security_level(self, subject, classification, compartments):
        security_level = SecurityLevel(
            classification=classification,
            compartments=compartments,
            timestamp=current_time()
        )
        
        # Validate clearance level
        if self.validate_clearance(subject, security_level):
            return self.set_security_level(subject, security_level)
        
        raise SecurityViolationError("Insufficient clearance")
```

### Access Control Decision
```python
def blp_access_control(subject, object_resource, operation):
    subject_level = get_security_level(subject)
    object_level = get_security_level(object_resource)
    
    if operation == 'READ':
        # Simple Security Property: No read up
        return (subject_level.classification >= object_level.classification and
                subject_level.has_compartments(object_level.compartments))
    
    elif operation == 'write':
        # Star Security Property: No write down
        return (subject_level.classification <= object_level.classification and
                object_level.has_compartments(subject_level.compartments))
    
    return False
```

### SELinux Integration
```python
def integrate_selinux_policy(policy_file):
    selinux_policy = parse_selinux_policy(policy_file)
    blp_policy = BellLaPadulaPolicy()
    
    for rule in selinux_policy.rules:
        if rule.type == 'mlsrule':
            blp_rule = translate_mls_rule(rule)
            blp_policy.add_rule(blp_rule)
    
    return blp_policy
```

### Ordered Group Implementation
```python
def calculate_group_clearance(user_id):
    ordered_groups = get_ordered_group_membership(user_id)
    clearance_mapping = load_group_clearance_mapping()
    
    highest_clearance = 0
    compartments = set()
    
    for group in ordered_groups:
        if group in clearance_mapping:
            clearance = clearance_mapping[group]
            highest_clearance = max(highest_clearance, clearance.level)
            compartments.update(clearance.compartments)
    
    return SecurityClearance(highest_clearance, compartments)

        cached_decision = self.get_cached_decision(subject, object_resource, operation)
        if cached_decision is not None:
            return cached_decision
        
        # Perform access control check
        decision = self.perform_blp_check(subject, object_resource, operation)
        
        # Cache the decision
        self.cache_decision(subject, object_resource, operation, decision)
        
        return decision
```

## Troubleshooting
