# SoDynTBAC - Resiliate Dynamic Trust-Based Access Control

## Overview

**SoDynTBAC** (Resiliate Dynamic Trust-Based Access Control) introduces a groundbreaking approach to access control within the Resiliate framework. Unlike conventional static permissions or role-based systems, SoDynTBAC employs a dynamic trust metric system reminiscent of financial credit scoring to determine access privileges.

## Core Concept

SoDynTBAC presents a revolutionary paradigm that abstracts various security metrics into dynamic "trust-credits" that are continuously evaluated to determine whether processes, users, or groups should maintain access to files and directories.

### Trust-Credit System

The system operates on a **trust-credit** model where:
- **Trust-Credits**: Allocated to processes, users, or groups based on historical behavior, roles, and security metrics
- **Access Costs**: Each file or directory carries an "access cost" determined through content-based analytics
- **Dynamic Decision Making**: Access is granted when trust-credits exceed the required access cost

## How SoDynTBAC Functions

### 1. Trust-Credit Allocation
Similar to financial credit scores, entities within an organization receive trust-credits based on:
- **Historical Behavior**: Past access patterns and security compliance
- **Role-Based Factors**: Organizational position and responsibilities  
- **Security Metrics**: Authentication strength, device trust, location factors
- **Temporal Factors**: Time-based adjustments for access patterns

### 2. Access Cost Determination
Each file or directory is assigned an "access cost" through:
- **Content-Based Analytics**: Analysis of data sensitivity and value
- **Keyword Detection**: Recognition of terms like "confidential", "proprietary", project identifiers
- **Data Pattern Analysis**: Identification of sensitive data patterns (credit cards, SSN, proprietary code)
- **Metadata Analysis**: File creator, creation date, edit history, organizational relevance
- **Dynamic Recalibration**: Costs adjust as content or organizational relevance changes

### 3. Access Decision Process
When access is requested:
1. **Trust-Credit Assessment**: Current trust-credit balance is evaluated
2. **Cost Calculation**: Required access cost for the resource is determined
3. **Comparison**: Trust-credits are weighed against access cost
4. **Decision**: Access granted if credits sufficient, denied otherwise
5. **Credit Adjustment**: Trust-credits may be debited based on access type

## Key Features

### Dynamic Adaptability
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: Trust-credits modify dynamically based on behavior changes
- **Role Evolution**: Automatic adjustment as user roles or responsibilities change
- **Threat Response**: Immediate credit reduction upon detection of suspicious activities

### Content-Based Intelligence
- **Automated Classification**: AI-driven content analysis for access cost determination
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understanding of organizational data value and sensitivity
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced detection of sensitive data patterns
- **Metadata Integration**: Comprehensive file metadata analysis

### Granular Control
- **File-Level Granularity**: Individual file access cost assignment
- **Directory Inheritance**: Configurable cost inheritance for directory structures
- **Multi-Dimensional Scoring**: Multiple factors contribute to trust calculations
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Organization-specific trust and cost parameters

## Applications in Organizations

## Technical Specifications

### Trust-Credit Calculation
```python
trust_credit = base_credit + 
               role_multiplier * role_score +
               behavior_history_score +
               authentication_strength_bonus +
               time_decay_factor +
               location_trust_factor
```

### Access Cost Calculation
```python
access_cost = base_cost +
              content_sensitivity_score +
              metadata_importance_factor +
              organizational_value_multiplier +
              regulatory_compliance_factor
```

### Decision Algorithm
```python
def grant_access(user, resource):
    user_credits = calculate_trust_credits(user)
    resource_cost = calculate_access_cost(resource)
    
    if user_credits >= resource_cost:
        deduct_credits(user, resource_cost)
        log_access_granted(user, resource)
        return True
    else:
        log_access_denied(user, resource, user_credits, resource_cost)
        return False
```
