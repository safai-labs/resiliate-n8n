# SoBibaMIC - Biba Mandatory Integrity Controls

## Overview

**SoBibaMIC** (Biba Mandatory Integrity Controls) is a Security Orchestrator plugin that provides mandatory integrity controls through both explicit and implicit security labels within the Resiliate ecosystem. This plugin enables security administrators to map access to files according to business rules and governance hierarchies based on the Biba integrity model.

## Description

SoBibaMIC implements the Biba Mandatory Integrity Model, which focuses on preventing unauthorized modification of data by enforcing integrity levels. The plugin supports both SELinux-style explicit security labels and implicit labeling through ordered-group membership of user IDs, providing flexible integrity control mechanisms for various organizational structures.

## Biba Integrity Model

The Biba model is built on three fundamental principles:

### 1. Simple Integrity Property (No Write Down)
- Subjects at a given integrity level cannot write to objects at a lower integrity level
- Prevents contamination of high-integrity data by low-integrity subjects
- Ensures data quality and trustworthiness throughout the system

### 2. Star Integrity Property (No Read Up)
- Subjects at a given integrity level cannot read from objects at a higher integrity level
- Prevents low-integrity subjects from being influenced by high-integrity data
- Maintains separation between different integrity levels

### 3. Invocation Property
- Subjects cannot invoke subjects at a higher integrity level
- Prevents privilege escalation through integrity level manipulation
- Maintains strict hierarchical integrity controls

## Key Features

### Dual Labeling System
- **Explicit Labels**: SELinux-compatible security labels for fine-grained control
- **Implicit Labels**: Ordered-group membership-based labeling for simplified management
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combination of explicit and implicit labeling for maximum flexibility
- **Dynamic Labeling**: Runtime adjustment of integrity levels based on context

### Business Rule Integration
- **Governance Hierarchies**: Mapping of integrity levels to organizational structures
- **Role-Based Integrity**: Integrity levels aligned with business roles and responsibilities
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated enforcement of business integrity policies
- **Compliance Automation**: Built-in support for regulatory compliance requirements

### Multi-Level Security
- **Hierarchical Levels**: Support for multiple integrity levels (e.g., Unclassified, Confidential, Secret, Top Secret)
- **Compartmentalization**: Fine-grained access control within integrity levels
- **Cross-Level Operations**: Controlled operations between different integrity levels
- **Level Validation**: Continuous validation of integrity level assignments

## Integrity Levels

### Standard Integrity Hierarchy
1. **System High**: Critical system components and configurations
2. **Administrative**: Administrative data and configurations

## Technical Implementation

### Integrity Level Assignment
```python
class BibaIntegrityManager:
    def assign_integrity_level(self, subject, object_type, business_rules):
        # Determine base integrity level
        base_level = self.calculate_base_level(subject, object_type)
        
        # Apply business rules
        adjusted_level = self.apply_business_rules(base_level, business_rules)
        
        # Validate against organizational policies
        final_level = self.validate_level(adjusted_level, subject)
        
        return final_level
```

### Access Control Enforcement
```python
def enforce_biba_policy(subject, object_resource, operation):
    subject_level = get_integrity_level(subject)
    object_level = get_integrity_level(object_resource)
    
    if operation == 'READ':
        # No read up rule
        return subject_level >= object_level
    elif operation == 'WRITE':
        # No write down rule
        return subject_level <= object_level
    elif operation == 'EXECUTE':
        # Invocation property
        return subject_level >= object_level
    
    return False
```

### Implicit Labeling Through Groups
```python
def calculate_implicit_level(user_id):
    ordered_groups = get_ordered_group_membership(user_id)
    integrity_mapping = load_group_integrity_mapping()
    
    highest_level = 0
    for group in ordered_groups:
        if group in integrity_mapping:
            level = integrity_mapping[group]
            highest_level = max(highest_level, level)
    
    return highest_level
```
