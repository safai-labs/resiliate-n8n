## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-03

### üèóÔ∏è **Foundation Release - Core Infrastructure Only**

This initial release provides the **foundational setup and development workflow** for the Resiliate Events n8n node. **This is NOT a feature-complete implementation** but rather the infrastructure needed for future development.

### ‚úÖ **What's Included (Core Setup)**
- **ResiliateEvents Trigger Node Framework**: Basic n8n webhook-based trigger node structure
- **Cross-Platform Development Workflow**: macOS development with Ubuntu server deployment
- **Automated Deployment Pipeline**: 
  - `auto_deploy_from_git.sh` - Git-based deployment automation
  - `deploy_to_n8n.sh` - Manual deployment script
  - `test_resiliate_webhook.sh` - Testing and connectivity verification
- **Custom Ninja Icon Integration**: High-resolution PNG ninja icon with proper n8n integration
- **Docker Environment Integration**: Seamless deployment to containerized n8n instances
- **Git Flow Workflow Implementation**: Production-ready branching strategy with main/next branches
- **Comprehensive Development Documentation**:
  - Complete README with project overview and roadmap
  - Development workflow guide with cross-platform instructions
  - macOS setup instructions for development environment
  - Warp terminal integration guide

### ‚úÖ **Technical Infrastructure**
- **TypeScript Development Environment**: Full type safety and modern JavaScript features
- **Build System**: Automated TypeScript compilation with asset management
- **Asset Pipeline**: Automatic copying of icons and assets during deployment
- **Error Handling**: Robust deployment scripts with validation and error checking
- **Version Control**: Complete git repository setup with proper .gitignore
- **Testing Framework**: Connectivity verification and webhook endpoint testing

### ‚ùå **What's NOT Implemented (Future Versions)**
- **Event Processing Logic**: Currently only basic webhook receiver, no event-specific processing
- **Resiliate API Integration**: No actual connection to Resiliate services or APIs
- **Advanced Event Filtering**: No event filtering, routing, or conditional logic
- **Error Handling & Retry**: Minimal error handling, no retry mechanisms or fault tolerance
- **Authentication & Security**: No API authentication, security validation, or access control
- **Event Transformation**: No data transformation, enrichment, or processing capabilities
- **Advanced Monitoring/Logging**: No detailed monitoring, metrics, or advanced logging features
- **Performance Optimization**: No caching, batching, or performance enhancements

### üéØ **Current Basic Functionality**
- Receives HTTP POST webhook requests
- Forwards raw JSON payload to n8n workflows (no processing applied)
- Basic webhook endpoint functionality for testing connectivity

### üìã **Development Environment Features**
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Develop on macOS, deploy to Ubuntu
- **Automated Deployment**: One-command deployment from git repository
- **Asset Management**: Proper handling of icons, images, and static assets
- **Documentation Suite**: Complete guides for setup, development, and deployment
- **Git Flow Integration**: Professional version control workflow

### üó∫Ô∏è **Roadmap for Future Versions**
- **v0.2.0**: Resiliate API integration, event authentication, basic processing
- **v0.3.0**: Advanced filtering, monitoring, performance optimizations
- **v0.4.0+**: Enterprise features, scalability improvements, advanced integrations

---

**Initial Release Note**: Version 0.1.0 establishes the complete development foundation and infrastructure. The actual Resiliate event processing features will be implemented in subsequent releases starting with v0.2.0.
